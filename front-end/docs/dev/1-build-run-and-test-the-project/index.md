Build, run & test the project
=============================

Aside from the deployment to Nexus (which is left to Maven, it's its domain after all), the project uses NPM to coordinate its build tasks. This section will present the different tasks, the tools used and options of interest.

## Installing the depencencies

`npm i` (or `npm install`, but the former is shorter)

## Quickstart

`npm run dev`
